# Go API Server for openapi

Hello World service with support for multiple languages.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

- API version: 1
- Build date: 2021-03-15T11:03:59.253350-04:00[America/New_York]

The purpose of this exercise is to validate that SLM can execute an initialization job prior to starting a microservice. 
Such initialization job is loaded as a container within component. 
Special directive in the container manifest suggests SLM loading the initialization job prior to load the microservice:

PrePopulate:
  Uid: slminitproofservice-1.0.0 

This example presents component and a microservice that executed after the initialization job is finished. 
The initialization job container implemented in the ‘go-slm-init-proof-service’ example


### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t openapi .
```

Once image is built use
```
docker run --rm -it openapi 
```
