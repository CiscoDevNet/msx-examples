# Metadata for the service to be deployed consisting of name, description, version, and type of service.
Name: "helloworldservice"
Description: "Hello World service with support for multiple languages."
Version: "1.0.0"
Type: Internal

# Wrapper for containers making up the service to be deployed.  Each service must have at least one container section
# which describes the Docker image to be used for the service.
Containers:
  - Name: "helloworldservice"
    Version: "1.0.0"
    Artifact: "helloworldservice-1.0.0.tar.gz"
    Port: 9515 #Service listening Port
    ContextPath: /helloworldservice # Context path to configure the application routing with

    # Collection of tags which will be inserted into Consul.  These tags can be used to query and offer specific functionality
    # to the service.  Certain (required) tags are automatically appended by the deployment process.  Others are highly
    # recommended and required if services need to show inside the MSX UI.  Here are some of the tags that you should consider
    # including:
    #      - "buildNumber=1.0.19"
    #      - "instanceUuid=45b40541-35c2-4c47-9f14-5ec511b7c365"
    #      - "buildDateTime=2020-10-10T17:51:34.965122Z"
    #      - "componentAttributes=serviceName:testservice~context:test~name:Test Service~description:Test Service~parent:platform~type:platform"
    #      - "swaggerPath=/swagger/"

    # Health check configurations.  Each container needs 1 health endpoint configured.  If a service has a specific
    # health endpoint implemented, please use the Http configuration along with the common health check section.  Otherwise,
    # for services that don't have a dedicated health endpoint implemented please configure the Tcp block and the host
    # will be pinged by the health checks instead.
    Check:
      Http:
        Scheme: "http"
        Host: "127.0.0.1" #FQDN or IP of service host if internal can be 127.0.0.1
        Path: "/helloworldservice"
      IntervalSec: 30 # how often (in seconds) should the system check if your service is up
      InitialDelaySec: 30 # initialization delay - how many seconds should the system wait after application is started before firing off the first health check request
      TimeoutSec: 30
      Port: 9515 # port to use for health checks if different from application's default listening port

    # In this section you need to specify the hardware requirements for your application.
    Limits:
      Memory: "384Mi"  # amount of memory/RAM that the application needs.  In this case the example asks for 512MB of RAM.  You should specify what your application needs based on your profiling findings.
      CPU: "1"  # number of virtual CPUs that the application needs

    # Command to use to start the application.
    Command:
      - "/service/dockerlaunch.sh"


# [Optional] Configuration section for infrastructure needs such as database for your application.
# List of required infra services required all are optional
# Consul and Vault access granted by default restricted to /<servicename> path in KV
# Population of Env defaults (e.g. cassandra address) will be done by onboarding service
Infrastructure:
  # Database configuration section.  The details for the account that was created for your service can be retrieved from Consul.
  # If your application needs Cassandra, the following configurations can be retrieved from Consul at startup/runtime:
  # - db.cassandra.username
  # - db.cassandra.password
  # - db.cassandra.keyspaceName
  #
  # If your application needs CockroachDB, the following configurations can be retrieved from Consul at startup/runtime:
  # - db.cockroach.username
  # - db.cockroach.password
  # - db.cockroach.databaseName
  Database:
    Type: Cockroach
    Name: "helloworldservice"


# [Optional] General configuration section for your application for values to be stored in Consul and be available to your application
# during startup and runtime.  The service configurations are in a sandbox with restricted access. Multiple name:value
# pairs can be specified.
ConsulKeys:
  - Name: "public.security.clientId"
    Value: "hello-world-service-public-client"
  - Name: "integration.security.clientId"
    Value: "hello-world-service-private-client"


# [Optional] Configuration section for sensitive values such as passwords.  The name:value pairs specified in the Secrets section
# will be inserted into secure configuration Vault and will be accessible to your application at startup and runtime.
# The service configurations are in a sandbox with restricted access.  Multiple name:value pairs can be specified.
Secrets:
  - Name: "integration.security.clientSecret"
    Value: "make-up-a-private-client-secret-and-keep-it-safe"
